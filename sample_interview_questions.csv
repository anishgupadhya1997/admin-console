"What are the key responsibilities of a SOC analyst?","A SOC analyst monitors security events, investigates alerts, responds to incidents, and maintains security documentation. Key responsibilities include: 1) Continuous monitoring of SIEM dashboards and security tools, 2) Analyzing and triaging security alerts based on severity and impact, 3) Conducting initial incident response and escalation procedures, 4) Documenting findings and maintaining incident records, 5) Threat hunting and proactive security monitoring.","SECURITY_OPERATIONS","ENTRY","soc,monitoring,incident response"
"Explain the shared responsibility model in cloud security","The shared responsibility model divides security duties between cloud provider and customer. The provider secures the infrastructure, physical security, and underlying services, while customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, identity and access management, operating systems, and network traffic protection. The exact division depends on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).","CLOUD_SECURITY","INTERMEDIATE","cloud,shared responsibility,aws"
"How would you design a secure network architecture?","A secure network architecture should include: 1) Network segmentation using VLANs and subnets, 2) Defense in depth with multiple security layers, 3) Zero trust principles with continuous verification, 4) Proper firewall configuration with least privilege access, 5) Intrusion detection and prevention systems, 6) Network monitoring and logging, 7) Regular security assessments and penetration testing, 8) Secure remote access solutions like VPN.","NETWORK_SECURITY","SENIOR","network,architecture,security design"
"Walk me through your penetration testing methodology","My penetration testing methodology follows these phases: 1) Planning and reconnaissance - gathering information about the target, 2) Scanning and enumeration - identifying live systems and services, 3) Vulnerability assessment - finding potential security weaknesses, 4) Exploitation - attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities, 5) Post-exploitation - maintaining access and pivoting, 6) Reporting - documenting findings with remediation recommendations. Each phase is thoroughly documented and follows ethical guidelines.","PENETRATION_TESTING","INTERMEDIATE","pentest,methodology,ethical hacking"
"Explain symmetric vs asymmetric encryption","Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it fast and efficient for large amounts of data but requiring secure key distribution. Examples include AES and DES. Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys (public and private), where data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other. It's slower but solves the key distribution problem and enables digital signatures. RSA and ECC are common examples. In practice, both are often used together in hybrid systems.","CRYPTOGRAPHY","INTERMEDIATE","encryption,cryptography,keys"
"Describe your malware analysis approach","My malware analysis approach involves both static and dynamic analysis. Static analysis examines the malware without execution, looking at file properties, strings, imports, and disassembled code using tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro. Dynamic analysis runs the malware in a controlled sandbox environment to observe behavior, network connections, file system changes, and registry modifications using tools like Procmon and Wireshark. I also use threat intelligence to correlate findings and identify malware families, and always follow proper containment procedures to prevent spread.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","ADVANCED","malware,analysis,reverse engineering"
