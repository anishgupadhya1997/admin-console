Key responsibilities include: 1) Continuous monitoring of SIEM dashboards and security tools, 2) Analyzing and triaging security alerts based on severity and impact, 3) Conducting initial incident response and escalation procedures, 4) Documenting findings and maintaining incident records, 5) Threat hunting and proactive security monitoring. Alert prioritization follows a risk-based approach considering factors like asset criticality, threat severity, business impact, and regulatory requirements. Critical alerts affecting core business systems take precedence over low-severity alerts on non-critical assets.",
