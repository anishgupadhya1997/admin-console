"What is the primary goal of static malware analysis?","To execute the malware in a sandbox","To examine malware without running it","To monitor system behavior in real time","To detect malware using network traffic","To examine malware without running it","Static malware analysis involves examining the malware binary, strings, and structure without executing it, to identify indicators such as file names, registry keys, or suspicious strings.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,static-analysis,soc"
"Which tool is commonly used for disassembling malware code?","Wireshark","Ghidra","Procmon","Netcat","Ghidra","Ghidra (or IDA Pro) is widely used for reverse engineering and disassembling malware binaries.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,reverse-engineering,static-analysis"
"What is the main purpose of dynamic malware analysis?","To reverse engineer code","To observe malware behavior while running","To compress malware for distribution","To remove malware from a system","To observe malware behavior while running","Dynamic analysis runs the malware in a controlled environment (sandbox/VM) to observe behavior such as network connections, file creation, and registry modifications.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,dynamic-analysis,soc"
"Which of the following is an indicator of malware persistence?","Creation of random temporary files","Scheduled tasks or registry run keys","Large file size","High CPU usage","Scheduled tasks or registry run keys","Malware often achieves persistence by creating scheduled tasks, registry Run/RunOnce keys, or services to ensure it runs after reboot.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,persistence,registry"
"Why do malware authors use packing techniques?","To increase file size","To make malware execution faster","To evade detection by obfuscating code","To simplify debugging","To evade detection by obfuscating code","Packers compress or encrypt malware code to hide its real instructions and evade detection by antivirus or analysis tools.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,packing,evasion"
"Which Windows tool can be used to monitor real-time process and registry changes by malware?","Ghidra","Procmon","Burp Suite","OllyDbg","Procmon","Procmon (Process Monitor) captures real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity, making it useful in dynamic analysis.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,process-monitoring,windows"
"What type of malware pretends to be legitimate software to trick users?","Rootkit","Worm","Trojan","Ransomware","Trojan","A Trojan disguises itself as a legitimate program to trick users into installing it, allowing attackers access or control.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,trojan,soc"
"Which network behavior might indicate malware activity?","High bandwidth usage during office hours","Frequent outbound connections to unknown IP addresses","Occasional software updates","Accessing intranet resources","Frequent outbound connections to unknown IP addresses","Malware often connects to Command & Control (C2) servers via unusual outbound traffic patterns to unknown or suspicious IPs.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,network,c2"
"What is the difference between a worm and a virus?","A worm requires user action; a virus spreads automatically","A worm spreads automatically; a virus needs user action","Both spread only via email","Both require system restart to activate","A worm spreads automatically; a virus needs user action","Worms self-propagate across systems without user action, while viruses usually require a host file or user execution.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,worm,virus"
"What is the role of a sandbox in malware analysis?","To clean malware from infected systems","To safely execute malware in an isolated environment","To obfuscate malware code","To scan malware signatures","To safely execute malware in an isolated environment","A sandbox is an isolated virtual environment that allows analysts to safely run and observe malware without risk to the host system.","MALWARE_ANALYSIS","INTERMEDIATE","malware,sandbox,dynamic-analysis"
